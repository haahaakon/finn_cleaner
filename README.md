## What
This addon looks through all ads on your finn.no search and removes ads containing the following words in their description:
`"dame", "dameklær", "barn", "barneklær"`


## Why
I like to look at used clothes on finn.no.
Their current filters are dependant on users choosing the correct category. (Which many don't)
You can do  terms like `(fjellraven or fjellreven) and not dame` to filter out based on **titles**.
But there is no filter to look through the **description** of the ads, where some people choose to specify.
